@mainpage TAG - TooN AlGorithm library

@section sIntro Introduction

Tag is a companion library to TooN, a C++ header file collection for numerics computation.
It provides a set of algorithms typically found in Computer Vision applications:

    - @ref kalmanfiltergroup 
    - @ref posegroup
    - @ref absorient
    - @ref handeye
    - @ref essentialgroup
    - @ref ransac
    - @ref unscented

Moreover it also provides general C++ standard library related helper classes and functions, dealing with:
    
    - @ref stdpp
    - @ref printf
    - @ref tuple

Why use this library ?
    - Based on TooN for efficient numerics calculations based on LAPACK and BLAS
    - Implementations tested in research prototypes and usually reasonable correct and stable
